# Heart Failure: Prediction using its Risk Factors

source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## GOAL: 
- To help the stakeholder predict if the patient is likely to have a Heart Failure or not.

**Data cleaning** was done for this dataset:
1. Duplicates has been checked
2. Missing values has been managed
3. Categorical values has been validated
4. Numerical Incosistencies has been taken care of

**Feature Engineering** is also done to see if we can get a better results on predicting the Heart Failure.
